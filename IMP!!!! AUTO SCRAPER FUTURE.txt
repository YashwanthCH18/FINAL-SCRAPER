That is a brilliant and critical question. You're thinking like a true platform architect. Stale content is a major threat to the quality of AI-generated material, and re-scraping without intelligence is inefficient and costly.

Let's break this down and brainstorm a robust solution. As you said, no code changes yet, just ideas.

The problem has two main parts:

Scheduling: How do we trigger the scraper automatically on a recurring basis?
Deduplication & Freshness: How do we ensure we only scrape new or updated content, not the same old stuff?
Part 1: The Scheduling Mechanism
The scraper is a microservice that responds to API calls. It doesn't have a built-in, persistent clock. Running a scheduler inside the FastAPI app itself (e.g., with apscheduler) is possible but has drawbacks in a production environment (it doesn't scale well and isn't resilient).

The best-practice, microservices-friendly approach is to use an external scheduler.

Proposed Solution: An External Cron Job or Cloud Scheduler

What it is: A separate, highly reliable service whose only job is to "wake up" at a set interval and make an API call.
How it works: You would configure this service to send a POST request to your /scraper/topic or /scraper/profile endpoint on a schedule (e.g., every Sunday at 3 AM).
Examples:
Cloud-Native: AWS EventBridge, Google Cloud Scheduler. These are cheap, serverless, and extremely reliable. This is the ideal production solution.
Traditional: A standard cron job on a Linux server that runs a curl command.
GitHub Actions: You can even set up a scheduled workflow in GitHub Actions to call your API endpoint.
This approach keeps the scraper "dumb" and stateless, which is exactly what we want for a scalable microservice.

Part 2: The Deduplication & Freshness Logic
This is the core of the problem. If our scheduler calls the scraper every week, we can't just re-scrape the same 10 URLs and create thousands of duplicate vectors in Pinecone. We need to be smart.

Proposed Solution: A "Scraped Content Ledger" in Supabase

Let's create a new table in Supabase to act as our "memory" of what has been scraped. Let's call it scraped_urls.

scraped_urls Table Schema:

id
: (Primary Key)
user_id
: (To know who this URL belongs to)
url: The exact URL that was scraped.
content_hash: An SHA-256 hash of the actual text content we extracted from the page. This is the magic ingredient.
last_scraped_at: A timestamp of when it was last successfully scraped.
The New, Intelligent Scraping Workflow:

The External Scheduler triggers the /scraper/topic endpoint.
The scraper runs 
rapid_search
 to get a list of candidate URLs.
Now, for each URL in the list, before we do anything else, we follow this logic: a. Fetch the page content using 
firecrawl_fetch
. b. Extract the text and calculate its content_hash. c. Query our new scraped_urls table in Supabase: SELECT content_hash FROM scraped_urls WHERE url = :current_url AND user_id = :user_id.
Make a decision based on the query result:
Case 1: URL is NOT in our table.
Action: This is brand new content! We process it, chunk it, upsert the vectors to Pinecone, and then insert a new row into scraped_urls with the URL, its content_hash, and the current timestamp.
Case 2: URL IS in our table.
Action: We compare the new_content_hash (from the live page) with the stored_content_hash from our table.
If the hashes are identical: The content has not changed. We do nothing. We skip this URL and move to the next one. This prevents duplicate data.
If the hashes are different: The page has been updated! This is fresh content. We process it, chunk it, and upsert the new vectors to Pinecone. Then, we update the existing row in scraped_urls with the new content_hash and the new last_scraped_at timestamp.
What about the old, stale vectors in Pinecone?
When a page is updated, we add new vectors. The old ones are still there.

Simple Approach (Recommended to start): Do nothing. The new, more relevant vectors will naturally have a higher similarity score to future queries and will be retrieved. The old ones will simply become "stale" and won't be surfaced.
Complex Approach (For future optimization): We could store the Pinecone vector IDs in our scraped_urls table. When we detect an update, we would first call pinecone.delete() to remove the old vectors before upserting the new ones. This keeps the index cleaner but adds significant complexity.
Summary of Brainstormed Changes:
Introduce an external scheduler to trigger the scraper periodically.
Create a new scraped_urls table in Supabase to track what we've scraped and its content hash.
Modify the 
crawl_and_embed
 function to include the deduplication logic: fetch, hash, compare, and then decide whether to skip, insert, or update.
How does this two-part strategy sound to you?
